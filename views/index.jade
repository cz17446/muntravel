                  | You will be dazzled by Vegas, but the sheer number of things
                  | to see and do can seem overwhelming. A little advance planning

                  | over 140 languages are spoken. The flavors, aromas, sights and sounds of
                  | almost every nation converge peacefully in the streets of Toronto's many
                  | neighborhoods: microcosms of culture thriving in a somewhat hazy 'bigger picture'
                  | that proud locals defend regardless.
